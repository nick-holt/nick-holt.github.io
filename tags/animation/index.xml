      <description>IntroductionHere is the problem: I’m building a simulation of a sequence of random events that leads to a specific outcome of interest only rarely. When I say rarely, I mean that the outcome I’m interested in only occurs by chance about 0.1% of the time. The simulation function I’m working with takes about 9 seconds to complete each iteration (likely indicating that I’m not the world’s most efficient coder), and so if the target outcome occurs every 1 in 1000 iterations on average, then I need to wait at least 2.</description>
