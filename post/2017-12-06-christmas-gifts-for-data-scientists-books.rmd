# Suggested reads for the holiday break

While browsing the /r/datascience subreddit the other day, I ran accross a blog post entitled: [**Geek Christmas: 10 best books to entertain a Data Scientist**](http://datawanderings.com/2017/12/01/geek-christmas-best-books-data-scientist/). The post contains a list of popular best sellers that loosely intersect with data science. 

I know I'm late to the party on this, but I'm currently reading Moneyball and enjoying it quite a bit. I plan to check out a few of the other titles listed in the post I linked. In addition, I wanted to throw in a few other books related to data science that I have found to be good reads.
