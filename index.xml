      <description>The contents of this document were presented as a talk to the Louisville R Users Group Meetup. Some of the content presented below was adapted from R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, which is an excellent resource. Specifically, Chapter 17 demonstrates the strengths of the purrr package, and I highly recommend the exercises throughout the chapter if you would like practice on this topic.

      <description>Suggested reads for the holiday break While browsing the /r/datascience subreddit the other day, I ran accross a blog post entitled: Geek Christmas: 10 best books to entertain a Data Scientist. The post contains a list of popular best sellers that loosely intersect with data science.
I know I&amp;rsquo;m late to the party on this, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading Moneyball and enjoying it quite a bit. I plan to check out a few of the other titles listed in the post I linked.</description>

      <description>Obligatory First Post: How I made this blog Honestly, creating this website could not have been much easier.

To pique your interest and demonstrate how simple it is to create a site like this in RStudio, here is the minimal code it took to genereate this blog:</description>
